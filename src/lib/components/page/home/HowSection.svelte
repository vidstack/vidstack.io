		Frontend + Video = Hard

			Since 2017, services that provide media encoding and delivery web APIs have been exploding. In
			contrast, frontend video tooling... *crickets*. Most current tools are from the stone age and
			not built for the modern web. They are hard to work with due to a lack of customizability,
			modularity, good docs, and requiring far too much JavaScript wiring/hackery. Nothing "just
			works."
		</p>

		<p class="mt-8">
			All of this is an unfortunate blocker and time waster for many developers, making it truly
			difficult to build a high-quality media experience that can rival some greats such as YouTube,
			Twitch, or Netflix. The problem compounds quickly as various challenges go beyond any single
			tool. For example, uploading media, creating engaging previews, custom players, chat
			integrations, analytics, and much more.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-8">
			At Vidstack, we're abstracting the complexity of building these tools into a simple set of web
			components and low-code services. We strive to deliver solutions that work with your existing
			tools, scale with your needs without getting in your way, and require as minimal steps and JS
			as possible.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-8">
			Ultimately, we're here to make building great media experiences more accessible.
