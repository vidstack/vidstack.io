Both the [Plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr) and [Vime](https://github.com/vime-js/vime)
libraries that we built came with [YouTube](https://youtube.com) support. That hasn't changed,
and it's on our 1.0 roadmap. You can find the [issue](https://github.com/vidstack/player/issues/13)
tracking it on GitHub, and you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vidstackjs?lang=en)
or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7RGU7wvsu9) to be notified of when it's ready.
